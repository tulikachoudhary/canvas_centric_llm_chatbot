Course Name: CSC20 Program Concept+Method II - SECTION 12, Course ID: 112990000000122808
Syllabus for course 112990000000122808:
Here is the syllabus: <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CSC 20&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Programming Concepts and Methodology II</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lecturer: Matthew Phillips</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Syllabus – Fall 2024</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>In the event a faculty member is not available during the semester for whatever reason, students will be contacted and advised how the course will proceed. This may include a change in instructor and/or modality.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>CSC 15.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule: </strong><strong><em>Lecture</em></strong>: Monday, Wednesday from 2:00pm to 2:50pm in Sequoia Hall 456</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Lab</em></strong>: Monday from 3:00pm to 4:40pm in Riverside Hall 2013 (For CSC 20-13)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">Wednesday from 3:00pm to 4:40pm in Riverside Hall 2013 (For CSC 20-14)</p>
<p><strong>Textbook: </strong>None Required. Java reference book ideas available upon request.</p>
<p><strong>Course Modality:</strong><span> This course is being taught on campus. However, I will still be placing all of the course materials online in Canvas as though this were an online course. However, due to University accreditation standards, it cannot be classified as an online course and you cannot schedule another course in this time slot.</span></p>
<p><strong>Office Hours: <span>Monday (On-campus @ RVR 3002), Wednesday and Friday (Online via <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://discord.gg/T97ykmQWEg" target="_blank">Discord</a>) 12:00pm - 12:50pm</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Materials: </strong>Access to a computer to complete lab and homework assignments; Ability to install a programming package to write code and compile with. This course will be in the Java programming language. You are free to use whatever (industry standard) editor / IDE you wish but I will be grading in Eclipse so make sure your workflow will be compatible with this.</p>
<p><strong>Course Description: </strong>Application of object-oriented techniques for systematic problem analysis and specification, design, coding, testing, and documentation. Semester-long project approach emphasizing larger programs. Managing program complexity using abstraction. Introduction to algorithm analysis and Big-O notation. Advanced language features. Basic sorting and searching algorithms. Recursion. Lecture two hours, technical activity and laboratory two hours.</p>
<p><strong>Course Structure: </strong></p>
<p>Course will consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lectures that provide the needed information to complete assignments and exams</li>
<li>A midterm exam that tests your specific knowledge of key material</li>
<li>Lab assignments that give you practice with various programming concepts</li>
<li>A semester long project to expose you to developing a non-trivial program</li>
<li>A final exam that ensures you possess the requisite knowledge to move forward in the study of Computer Science (or satisfy course expectations)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Midterm: </strong>The midterm will be an examination that tests your knowledge of information presented in the lectures. It will be done in class (Part 1 on Monday, Part 2 on Wednesday of Week 8).</p>
<p>The midterm is worth a maximum of 200 points. It will be a combination of multiple choice and matching questions.</p>
<p><strong>Final Exam: </strong>The final will be an examination that tests your knowledge of ALL information presented in this course. It will cover what we went through in the lectures over the course of the semester. It is comprehensive (as are most things in Computer Science.) It will be given on Canvas.</p>
<p>The final exam is worth a maximum of 250 points. It will be a combination of multiple choice and matching questions.</p>
<p><strong>The Final Exam cannot be pushed back so make your plans to take it on the day listed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Semester Project: </strong>This will be a larger scale program that you will write over the course of the semester. It will utilize many of the coding elements you learn over the course of the semester as well as fundamental techniques that you should have learned in CSC 15. This project is worth 250 points and will be due on the final day of class.</p>
<p>The semester project must have the student’s name on it for the student to receive credit for it. Because this is due on the last day of class (and grades being due shortly after), this assignment is not eligible for credit if late.</p>
<p><strong><em>Warning: Semester projects are individual assignments and thus must be done entirely by yourself (except the db.txt file which is allowed to be shared). Duplicate student code will be considered an Academic Integrity Violation under the rules listed in this Syllabus!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Labs: </strong>There will be ten lab assignments worth 25 points each. These are geared toward reinforcing a particular concept or small group of concepts. I will be posting weekly slides or notes that help you get through the labs. You are also always welcome to ask about the labs via email or Canvas. I will set up a Discord server for communication as well.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Labs must have the student’s name on them for the student to receive credit for it. Due to the comprehensive nature of this subject (and the fact that I go over lab solutions in class to learn from), late work is not eligible for credit.</p>
<p><span>Lab assignments are individual assignments and must be done by the student themselves. It is okay to form study groups and/or ask a tutor/lab assistant for help understanding concepts but they should not do the work for you. Academic integrity has been an issue in this course lately so I want to make this clear! Duplicate assignments will result in zero for the assignment. Repeated violations may result in a referral to the Dean of Students for further review.</span></p>
<p><strong>Computer Science Hero:</strong> This is a “game show” type of event I hold in all of my Computer Science classes. It is a lecture period that is used for groups of students to compete against each other for extra credit by answering computer science questions that I prepare for you.</p>
<p>Although extra credit only goes to the winning team, all who participate will be given the 50 points for this as part of the requirements for this class. Failure to attend will result in you losing 50 points for the missed session.</p>
<p>Attendance for this is not optional, and this is a part of your grade.</p>
<p><em><strong>COVID-19 exception for assignments and participation</strong>: If you become ill or are placed under quarantine due to COVID-19, you can receive additional time to complete your assignments (and discussion postings) if you give me notification. I understand that these are trying times and the University is behind you as well to ensure your success even if you fall victim to this terrible situation.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>Academic Honesty</strong></p>
<p>You are welcome to view the<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="external" href="https://www.csus.edu/student-affairs/student-conduct/academic-dishonesty.html" target="_blank"><span>University's policy on Academic Honesty</span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a>.</p>
<p>Plagiarism and cheating are against University policy. Minor violations will result in a warning from me and possibly receiving no credit for the assignment in question. Major violations (i.e. cut and pasting an entire assignment from an online source OR two students having eerily similar assignment submissions that warrant a reasonable suspicion of cheating) will result in being referred to the Area Dean for further review.</p>
<p>If you ever are in doubt about whether something violates Academic Integrity, please ask. There is never anything wrong with asking a question and it is always better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Instructor Contact: </strong>My faculty email is: &lt;<strong>matthew.phillips@csus.edu</strong>&gt;. I will be checking the email frequently during the semester. Expect a reply within 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance Policy</strong></p>
<p><span>I will likely only be taking attendance during the first two weeks of the semester (exception is Computer Science Hero). Failure to attend initial class meetings (during those first two weeks) could result in me dropping you from the course if other students are attempting to add. You are responsible for keeping up with weekly lecture modules and labs whether you choose to attend class or not. I will not update you on what you missed when you are absent. It is up to you to reach out to classmates to get information about missed material.</span></p>
<p><strong>Student Conduct</strong></p>
<p>Students are expected to keep up with their required weekly modules and labs. You are welcome to post on the course Discord server or the Canvas course Discussion Board, but the following apply:</p>
<p><strong><em>These are codes of conduct that we should all follow:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Treat others in the course with respect regardless of skill level or prior knowledge (we don't want to act like “know-it-alls” and scare others away from asking questions and learning. Let's foster a community of free thinking and scholarship.)</li>
<li>Have a strong work ethic. Computer Science and Software Development are not “slacker” majors or careers. They require a level of dedication that not everyone possesses. You have made it this far because you have put in time, effort, and commitment to accomplish a goal. This class is just one more step on your road toward success. Don't falter now!</li>
<li>Learn how to “think” for yourself: do not always rush to look up solutions on Stack Overflow or other websites. Try to program your brain to solve problems the old-fashioned way...using your head! Problems can be difficult and frustrating but solving these problems is rewarding in a way that few other things in life are.</li>
<li>Understand that we all have our own way of doing things. If I am lecturing about a concept and you dislike my coding style (you might find it too verbose) than simply code differently. There is no need to waste class time pointing out that you code in a different manner. I often break code down to small steps to demonstrate a concept clearly so questions of “why don't you code it like this instead?” are a waste of time and needlessly combative. If you have a legitimate question or concern about the effectiveness of an example, I give you, feel free to share. I simply do not wish to use valuable class time to debate coding styles with a single student. If you must do that, save it for before / after class or email.</li>
<li>Unless specified, you are NOT to use Java API methods (any method that requires an “import” keyword from the Java API) to solve class problems. (e.g. If I ask you to find the largest value in an array, do NOT use Math.max to solve this.) Using Java API methods to solve lab or final project problems will result in zero points for that portion of the assignment. If you are ever unsure or unclear about when Java API methods are allowed, feel free to ask me via email, the course Discussion Board, or Discord.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Learning Accommodation </strong></p>
<p>If you are a student with a learning disability, a physical disability, or other special needs, please let me know as soon as possible if you need special accommodations. These discussions are best handled by special appointment with me. All needs that have been verified through the appropriate campus department will be accommodated.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 Information (required by University)</strong></p>
<p><span>If you are sick, stay home and do not attend class. Notify your instructor. If you are experiencing any COVID- like symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, loss of smell or taste, nausea, diarrhea, or headache) or have had exposure to someone who has tested positive for COVID contact&nbsp;</span><strong>Student Health &amp; Counseling Services (SHCS) at 916-278-6461</strong><span>&nbsp;to receive guidance and/or medical care. You are asked to report any possible COVID related illnesses/exposures to SHCS via this link&nbsp;</span><a class="external" href="https://www.csus.edu/compliance/risk-management/coronavirus.html" target="_blank"><span>COVID-19 Illness/Exposure Report Form</span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a><span>. Expect a call from SHCS within 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><strong>Crisis Assistance and Resource Education Support (CARES) Information (required by University)</strong></p>
<p><strong>As a reminder to students, use the CARES statement of support.<br></strong>The Crisis Assistance and Resource Education Support (CARES) office recommends using the following statement to remind students of the resources available to them. This statement is available for faculty or staff to use in syllabi, signature lines, or wherever is helpful.<br><br>“If you are experiencing challenges with food, housing, financial or other unique circumstances that are impacting your education, help is just a phone call or email away! The CARES office provides case management support for any enrolled student. Email the CARES office at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:cares@csus.edu">cares@csus.edu</a><span>&nbsp;to speak with a case manager about the resources available to you. Check out the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://bit.ly/3fhQ1kY">CARES website</a><span>.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Sexual Misconduct Disclosure Statement (recommended by University)</strong></p>
<p>Sac State is committed to supporting students and fostering a campus environment free of sexual misconduct<br>and gender-based discrimination. If a student chooses to disclose to a faculty or staff member an experience<br>related to sexual misconduct which includes, but is not limited to rape, relationship violence, or stalking, all<br>faculty and staff members are obligated to report this disclosure to the university’s Title IX Coordinator. Contact<br>Sac State’s Title IX Coordinator, Skip Bishop, at (916) 278-5770 or email at william.bishop@csus.edu. Upon<br>receipt of the report, the Title IX Coordinator will contact you to inform you of your rights and options as a<br>survivor and connect you with support resources, including resolution options for holding accountable the<br>person who harmed you. Students who elect not to discuss their experience with the Title IX Coordinator can<br>speak confidentially to the following confidential resources:</p>

<li>A window will pop up saying “Select how files should be imported into the project” and you make sure the “Copy files” radio button is selected and click “OK”</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Your class must incorporate the following elements to work correctly (and get full points):</strong></p>
<p><em>Have a class constructor that takes an int array as a parameter</em></p>
<p>This array should be saved as a private field in the fields section of the class. This is so we can call dynamic methods later without having to keep passing the array as a parameter.</p>
<p><em>Have a dynamic method called “getSize”</em></p>
<p>This method must have an int return value and NO parameters. We must return how many elements exist in the array that was passed to the constructor at object initialization.</p>
<p><em>Have a dynamic method called “getElement”</em></p>
<p>This method must have an int return value and a single int parameter. We must return the value of the array element at the <u>index given in the parameter</u>. The array is the original array passed to the constructor at object initialization. If an array is empty, this should return -1.</p>
<p><em>Have a dynamic method called “getMax”</em></p>
<p>This method must have an int return value and NO parameter. We must return the value of the array element that has the largest value in the whole array. The array is the original array passed to the constructor at object initialization. If the array is empty, this should return -1.</p>
<p><em>Have a dynamic method called “getSum”</em></p>
<p>This method must have an int return value and NO parameter. We must return the total sum of ALL the array values in the array. (e.g. If a = {1,2,3} then sum would be 1+2+3 = 6.) The array is the original array passed to the constructor at object initialization. If the array is empty, this should return 0.</p>
<p><em>Have a static method called “getStaticMin”</em></p>
<p>This method must have an int return value and a single int array parameter. We return the value of the array element that has the smallest value in the whole array. The array, in this case, is the array you received via the parameter. The reason for this is because this is a static method and, thus, does not require an initialized object to use. Therefore, we must provide the array as a parameter. If the array is empty, this should return -1.</p>
<p><em><strong>Autograder</strong></em></p>
<p>This particular lab uses an autograder to assign a grade. I use an autograder because it tests the essential functionality of the program without interjecting bias into the grading process (since an autograder cannot be bias; something either fulfills the requirements or it doesn't.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all assignments are conducive to using an autograder but this lab is. I am giving you the autograder for you to test your program and know what grade you can expect. <a class="instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled" title="lab01_autograde.txt" href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/11299~122808/files/11299~21260375?verifier=T2QJOnfHpqHiWkQznHzLKHNOpbP9LwXQx8asdFj4&amp;wrap=1" target="_blank" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/11299~122808/files/11299~21260375" data-api-returntype="File">Here is the autograder</a>.

<p><strong>Parsing Strings</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this lab is for you to review how to parse and interpret Strings in Java using the StringTokenizer class of the Java API.</p>
<p><em>Steps:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><a class="instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file" title="Lab02.java" href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/11299~122808/files/11299~21260317/download?verifier=mpXaVUgoOFvF7ZiUKHM5lMSvXmGSs8czVaBVoJPy&amp;wrap=1" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/11299~122808/files/11299~21260317" data-api-returntype="File">Download the file “Lab02.java"</a></li>
<li>Drag and drop the “Lab02.java” file from the folder you downloaded it to into your Eclipse project on the “Main” package icon on the Package Explorer in the “Labs” project (If you haven’t created a Labs project, do so now).</li>
<li>A window will pop up saying “Select how files should be imported into the project” and you make sure the “Copy files” radio button is selected and click “OK”</li>
<li>Open the “Lab02.java” file from the Package Explorer and enter your name at the top in the area that says “Your name here: “ <strong>Failure to have your name on this assignment will result in zero points for the assignment!</strong></li>

The ONLY file that should be submitted is your “Lab02.java“ file; </em></strong>Follow the specifications below to get full credit for the assignment:</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Lab 2 Specifications</em></strong></p>
<p>Using the string array “movies” given to you in the first part of the code, do the following…</p>
<p>Create the following arrays to hold the parsed data:</p>
<ul>
<li>A String array named “titles” to hold the movie titles</li>
<li>A primitive integer array named “years” to hold the year of the movies</li>
<li>A String array named “stars” to hold the star of each movie</li>
<li>A primitive float array named “runtimes” to hold the runtime of each movie, in hours</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hint: The length of each array should be taken from the length of the database array “movies”</em></p>
<p>Create a loop that iterates through the strings in the “movies” array. In each iteration, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the line into a temporary string called “raw”</li>
<li>Create a String Tokenizer named “st” and recall that our delimiter is the “*” character (asterisk)</li>
<li>Save the first token into titles</li>
<li>Save the second token into years</li>
<li>Save the third token into stars</li>
<li>Save the last token into runtimes</li>
</ul>
<p>Some “gotchas” to remember are:</p>
<ul>
<li>StringTokenizer string tokens are the String data type. If you are saving to other data types, you must first convert the string to that type.</li>
<li>Make sure to only retrieve four tokens per read line. Any more will result in a NoSuchElementException being thrown.</li>
<li>Only read as many lines as what there are in the “movies” array. Any more will result in Exceptions being thrown.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the loop, make sure to display each of the arrays with a header before them. Your output should look like this:</p>
<p>-----MOVIES-----</p>
<p>Shawshank Redemption</p>
<p>The Godfather</p>
<p>Raging Bull</p>
<p>Million Dollar Baby</p>
<p>Straight Outta Compton</p>
<p>-----YEARS-----</p>
<p>1994</p>
<p>1972</p>
<p>1980</p>
<p>2004</p>
<p>2015</p>
<p>-----STARS-----</p>
<p>Tim Robbins</p>
<p>Al Pacino</p>
<p>Robert De Niro</p>
<p>Hilary Swank</p>
<p>Jason Mitchell</p>
<p>-----RUNTIMES-----</p>
<p>2.36</p>
<p>2.92</p>
<p>2.15</p>
<p>2.2</p>
<p>2.45</p>
<p>Make sure your output is created by actually displaying the value of the arrays and not typing the String literals as parameters. You should, ideally, be using a loop to iterate through the elements of the array to display it with the minimal amount of code. Add the appropriate headers before each array (as shown above) to receive full credit for a clear and organized presentation of data.</p>
<p>I don't have a set rubric for this assignment. I will start everyone out with 25 points, but you will lose points for mistakes that deviate from the specifications listed here.</p>
<p>I reserve the right to weigh the point reduction of mistakes as I see fit for this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>Abstraction using Interfaces</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this lab is for you to learn how to achieve abstraction in Java using interfaces. These have the advantage over abstract classes in that we have “multiple inheritance” safely. Java does not allow multiple inheritance of classes directly due to the “Diamond Problem.”</p>
<p><em>Steps:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Create the file “Lab03.java” in your Eclipse Package Explorer inside of your Main package.</li>
<li>For this assignment, you will do ALL of your coding in the “Lab03.java” file. Follow the specifications below to get full credit for the assignment:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Lab 3 Specifications</em></strong></p>
<p>Create a single Java code file (Lab03.java) that contains:</p>
<p>Three separate interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>One that uses unimplemented methods (just method prototypes)</li>
<li>One that uses a default method or methods</li>
<li>One that uses a static method</li>
</ul>
<p>Create your main class (Lab03) that implements ALL 3 of these interfaces.</p>
<p>Write the implementation for the methods in the first interface mentioned above in your main method.</p>
<p>Write the main method that uses all of the methods in the 3 interfaces.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hints</em></strong></p>
<p>*Use the class code as a guide to help you figure out how this all works. Do NOT copy the class code for the assignment. Come up with your own interface ideas but simply use class code as an outline for how the flow can go.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget (in the main method) to create an object of the Lab03 class to access interface methods!</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Submission</em></strong></p>
<p>Upload the source file “Lab03.java” to Canvas by the due date and time for credit.</p>
<p>ANY ERRORS IN COMPILING WILL RESULT IN POINT DEDUCTIONS IF MINOR OR ZERO POINTS IF SEVERE. THE PROGRAM MUST BE ABLE TO COMPILE WITHOUT MODIFICATION FOR FULL CREDIT!</p>

<p><strong>Creating Packages and Importing Classes</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this lab is for you to learn how to become proficient in creating packages in Java and being able to import these packages into classes in other packages. Management of different source code files and folders is key to programming organization, scalable project size, and promoting reusability in software development.</p>
<p><em>Steps:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new Java Project named “Packages” from within Eclipse.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Following the example in the Week 6 lecture, create six packages: Main, add, subtract, multiply, divide, and modulo. ALL of these packages should be within the “src” folder in the Eclipse package Explorer. ALL of the packages should be on the same “level” in the file hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>In the “Main” package, create the “Lab04.java” file and add the needed boilerplate (“Hello, World!” style) code to create the main method for the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>For each of the arithmetic packages (add, subtract, multiply, divide, and modulo), create a single class (you should name these files the same as the package name but capitalized; e.g. “Add.java”, “Subtract.java”, “Multiply.java”, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the specifications below for detailed implementation details:</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Lab 4 Specifications</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Inside each of the arithmetic classes (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Modulo), make sure EACH class contains the following:</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two private fields</p>
<p>// Example Fields:</p>
<p>private int n1;</p>
<p>private int n2;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A constructor that passes two values that can be saved in the private fields</p>
<p>// Example Constructor:</p>
<p>public Add(int n1, int n2){</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.n1 = n1;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.n2 = n2;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following three methods must be supported by ALL arithmetic classes:</p>
<p>public int getResult();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // This should return the result of n1 <em>arithmetic operator</em> n2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // n1 + n2 for add</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>public void changeVals(int n1, int n2);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // This should change or “reset” the values in the</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // private class fields</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>public String toString();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // This returns a string that displays the equation with result</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // e.g. “3 + 5 = 8”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Inside the “Lab04.java” file should contain the following:</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>All package and import statements needed to reference the other packages and classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inside the main method, create class objects for each of arithmetic classes</p>
<p>// Example:</p>
<p>Add a = new Add(5, 3);</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each class object, make sure to ALSO print out the toString method of each to verify the current equation, call the method to change the values, and print out the toString method again to verify the changes.</p>
<p>// Example:</p>
<p>System.out.println(a.toString());</p>
<p>a.changeVals(4, 4);</p>
<p>System.out.println(a.toString());</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verify, by running the program, that everything works as expected.</p>
<p><strong><em>Submission</em></strong></p>
<p>Use a video capture program like FRAPS or Bandicam (free versions are fine) and record a short video with your code window open, expanded Package Explorer panel, and run the program to show the output in your console window.</p>
<p>Upload your short video to Canvas by the due date and time for credit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Do NOT submit single source code files or .class files. The only permitted file is your video file for credit. All others will get a zero for the assignment.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><em>If you have any questions, let me know.</em></p>

<p><em>Statement of Respect</em></p>
<p>Treating people with respect and dignity is not only an ethos of this institution, but is also the responsibility of individuals as global citizens. Creating a space where ideals, thoughts, and beliefs can be discussed in the pursuit of knowledge, a shared experience, or genuine, honest discussion can only occur with mutual respect. Questions, assumptions, statements, thoughts, and beliefs can then be challenged (free of personal attacks) in a productive way and produce generative dialogue once that respect is established. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Land Acknowledgment</em></p>
<p>The concept and act of privatizing land was brought to this region by non-native or invasive people. Indigenous people in, what is now, California lived on the land and the resources it provided, but through colonization and ethnocide were displaced. The Miwok and Nisenan were the original human inhabitants of this particular land, which looked vastly different than it does today; these people and communities still reside in this area. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Assignment: Five Sentences on Death - Due: 2024-09-17T06:59:59Z - Instructions: <p>This assignment is an exercise for brainstorming ideas for your essay. Your task is to write 5 sentences on a view that we have covered in the lectures in the module on death. Your submission must have the following format:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Sentence 1: [name of philosopher or philosophical text <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we covered in the lectures</span>] says that <span style="color: #e03e2d;">[insert a simple complete sentence of the view you will address]</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Sentence 2: [name of the same philosopher or philosophical text] says that because <span style="color: #e03e2d;">[insert a one-sentence summary of a main reason the philosopher or the text uses to support the view]</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Sentence 3: I disagree that this is a good reason because<span style="color: #e03e2d;"> [insert a one-sentence summary of the main reason why you think the philosopher's/text's reason is not good evidence for the view]</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Sentence 4: [name of the philosopher or "the author of the philosophical text"] might respond to my objection by saying that <span style="color: #e03e2d;">[insert a one-sentence summary of the strongest potential objection against what you said in sentence 3]</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Sentence 5: This potential objection does not work because <span style="color: #e03e2d;">[insert a one-sentence summary of your reply to the objection against yourself that you anticipated in sentence 4]</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>note 1:&nbsp;</strong></em><em>sentence 3 is <strong>not</strong> asking you to say why you disagree with the view; it asks you to <strong>evaluate the reason</strong> the philosopher/text offers is no good</em></p>
<p><em><strong>note 2:</strong> when you are writing sentence 4, imagine it like you are playing chess. It is not enough that you make your move; you also have to be able to put yourself into the mindset of the person you are challenging and try to anticipate that person's response</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grading Rubric</strong></p>
<p>One point per sentence. The red parts must be filled in with a grammatical, complete sentence. (That is, don't just throw in a key word and hope I would understand what you want to say!) The view and reasoning you address in Sentence 1 and 2 must be covered in the course lectures; otherwise, you won't get any of the points. This means, this assignment cannot be completed with random googling things without going through the lectures properly.</p>

Assignment: Module 01 Death - Due: 2024-09-16T06:59:59Z - Instructions: <p>In this module, we covered a few perspectives on the topic of death. You don't have a firm stance. But I suppose you would lean slightly towards one of those views, even if you are not 100% sure about it. This is a two part assignment. The first part has a firm deadline (09/15 midnight). You have till the end of the semester (12/10 midnight) for the second part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PART 1.</strong> <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>by 09/15 midnight </strong></span>(for 3 points max.)</p>
<p>I set up one thread for each of the views we covered in this course. Pick the one that you lean towards (i.e., if you really have to make a choice among these views, that's the one you would pick). Post a reply to the thread that corresponds to the view you pick. <strong>(E.g., if you want to defend Epicurus, your post should be a reply to my post "Epicurus's reasoning about death". The idea is to classify everyone's post according to what view you defend.)</strong>&nbsp;In your reply, you should explain one by one why each of the other views is not as convincing to you as the one you picked. Don't worry about this. This is just to give you a platform to express your thinking on the subject. There is no such things as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the right answer</strong></span> to this assignment.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">+1 point = you address all the other views</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">+1 point = you comment is based on a more or less accurate understanding of the views</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">+1 point = you say something reasonable to explain why each of the other views are not as convincing as the one you picked</p>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> You cannot read other people's comments before making your own reply. So, don't worry if you don't see other people's posts. You will not be allowed to edit your post. Make sure you proofread before posting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PART 2.</strong> <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>by 12/10 midnight</strong></span> (for 1 point)</p>
<p><span style="color: #843fa1;">Go to a thread of a view you didn't pick for Part 1. In the thread, you will find your classmates criticizing the view you picked in Part 1, saying why the view about death you picked is wrong. Pick a post from a classmate that no one has responded to yet. Post a reply to that classmate. In your response, defend your choice and explain why what your classmate objection is not convincing. (You may respond to a post that others have replied to already only when all posts are responded to already.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #843fa1;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For example</span>, if for Part 1 you made a post on Epicurus, for Part 2, you can go to the thread about Zhuangzi's view about death and see why your classmates rejected Epicurus's view. Reply to one of them and explain why you think their objection to Epicurus does not work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Assignment: Module 02 Love - Due: 2024-10-07T06:59:59Z - Instructions: <p>In this module, we covered a few perspectives on the topic of love. This is a two part assignment. Again, there is a deadline for the first part (10/06 midnight); you have till the end of the semester (12/10 midnight) for the second part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PART 1.</strong> <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>10/06 midnight </strong></span>(for 3 points max.)</p>
<p>I set up one thread for each of the views we covered. Pick one that you agree with (or lean towards). Post a reply not to this main post but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">under the thread you pick</span>. In your reply:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">+1 point = Briefly explain a sad story about love you find (doesn't have to be romantic love; we understand "love" very broadly). It doesn't matter where you find it: it can be on reddit, celebrity gossips, news, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">+2 points = Explain how people in the story could have benefitted from learning about the view about love you picked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PART 2.</strong> <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>by 12/10 midnight </strong></span>(for 1 point)</p>
<p><span style="color: #843fa1;">Find a post from your classmate for PART 1 that no one has replied to yet. Post a reply. Your classmate has posted a story that used that to show why one of the views about love we learned about is valuable. In your reply, explain how another philosopher we cover would have a different take on the story (you don't need to agree with this other philosopher's; I just want you to try to put yourself in another person's mindset and see if you can see things from their viewpoint). You get 1 point if your reply more or less accurately express that other philosopher's way of thinking about love.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Assignment: Module 03 Freedom - Due: 2024-10-28T06:59:59Z - Instructions: <p>We covered 5 views about freedom in this module. Unlike the views we discussed in the first two modules, the views in this modules aren't necessarily disagreeing with each other; they are more like discussions on 5 different aspects or kinds of freedom:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(i) free flow of information (Zollman)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(ii) freedom from emotion (Damasio)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(iii) freedom from usefulness (Zhuangzi)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(iv) freedom and options (Locke &amp; Frankfurt)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(v) duty to obey the law (Plato vs. Simmon)</p>
<p>Post replies <span style="text-decoration: underline;">under the 5 threads below</span> (i.e., do not reply to this main post) according to the instructions to pick up maximum 4 points (feel free to post more and discuss among yourselves even if it won't give you more points). As you can see, there are totally 7 points available. You get to choose which task to do to pick up these 4 points.</p>
<p><strong>There are two deadlines.</strong> For tasks that ask for an original post, the <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>due date is 10/27 midnight</strong></span>; for the tasks that ask you to reply to your classmates (<span style="color: #843fa1;">in purple</span>), the <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>due date is 12/10 midnight</strong></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Assignment: Module 04 Knowledge & Reality - Due: 2024-11-18T07:59:59Z - Instructions: <p>In this module, we covered only three topics, but pretty complex topics. Post replies to the following three thread according to instructions to earn up to 4 points!</p>
<p><strong>There are two deadlines.</strong> The tasks that ask for an original post are <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>due on 11/17 midnight</strong></span>; the tasks that ask you to reply to your classmates' post (<span style="color: #843fa1;">in purple</span>) are <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>due on 12/10 midnight</strong></span>.</p>

Assignment: Complete Activity 2:                    Write a Reflective Essay - Due: None - Instructions: <h2>What is Reflective Writing</h2>
<p>Reflective writing is something students regularly perform in all of our first-year writing courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Writing a reflection means looking back on a specific learning process you experienced and analyzing the skills you used and developed during that process. The purpose of reflective writing is to explore and describe how past and present experiences shaped the way you completed a particular task or activity. It requires more than simply listing what you did or what you learned; it requires you to write about why these moments are important for when you take on similar tasks in the future.</p>
<p><strong>An effective piece of reflective writing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provides a rich description of the situation that shaped the writing task the writer is reflecting on</li>
<li>Connects the impact of experiences, ideas, and interactions to the author’s learning</li>
<li>Organizes the material in a logical progression with clear connections among ideas</li>
<li>Displays few errors in mechanics, grammar, usage, and spelling</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Activity 2 Directions</strong></h2>
<p>Use word processing software (such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs) to write a double-spaced, one-page essay.</p>
<p>The essay should provide insight into how you have developed as a writer in the past few years. Please use the guiding questions below to inform your essay, but remember you <strong>are not required</strong> to answer every question.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you feel about the writing you have done in school (for example, in your English, history, math, and science classes)?</li>
<li>How is this similar or different from the writing you do outside of school?&nbsp;</li>
<li>How would you describe your ability to write for various purposes (for example, summary, analysis, research projects)?</li>
<li>What do you already know about writing in college (for example., how to plan, draft, revise, and reflect)?</li>
<li>What experiences have you had that are key to your understanding of writing in college?</li>
<li>What do you think you will gain in your first-year writing course that you can use as a student in your major, as a professional in your job, and as a citizen of the world?</li>
</ul>
<h2>To submit the essay</h2>
<p>Save the file as a .DOC, .DOCX, or a .PDF. Then click on the "Submit Assignment" button in the top right corner of this page, upload your draft, and click submit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
